    "Supervised learning is a type of ML where the algorithm learns from labelled data, consisting input-outpur pairs . In Supervised learning we train the algorithm on a dataset consistng input features and corresponding output labels. The goal is to learn the mapping or relationship between the input features and output labels, which helps in making predictions on unseen , new data\n",

    "## Supervised Learning Categories \n",
    "There are two major categories of sypervised learning based on the nature of the target variable\n",

    "- Regression\n",
    "  - When the target variable is continuous value, the prdediction task is called as regression. or example predicting the temperature from a set input values like wind, humidity etc.\n",
    "- Classification\n",
    "  - When the target variable is caegorical value, the prdediction task is called as classification. for example predicting the weather (hot/cold) from a set input values like wind, humidity etc.\n",
